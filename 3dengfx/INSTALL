3dengfx 0.5 - installation instructions
---------------------------------------

If you wish to change the configuration edit 3dengfx_config.h in the src
subdirectory. You shouldn't need to do that under most circuimstances, the
defaults are rather reasonable, and there aren't many configuration options
anyway.
Then:

./configure
make
make install

By default the installation prefix is /usr/local.

Requirements
------------
OpenGL
SDL or GTK (experimental option)
libpng
libjpeg
lib3ds
freetype 2
